summary: "You can publish your docs via SSH through a Terminal window or more likely, via a shell script that you simply execute as part of the publishing process. However, you will be prompted for your password with each file transfer unless you configure passwordless SSH. The basic process for setting up password less SSH is to create a key on your own machine that you also transfer to the remote machine. When you use the SCP command, the remote machine checks that you have the authorized key and allows access without a password prompt."
